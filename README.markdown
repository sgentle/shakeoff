# Shakeoff - highly accurate web-based business simulator

Shakeoff is a game where two players attempt to handshake as close to their own side as possible. There's a 10-second time limit, though, so you have to be quick.

Because it's the hot new thing, actual gameplay happens in the URL bar.

On the backend, shakeoff is based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the excellent [Socket.io](http://socket.io). On the frontend, [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and the [HTML5 history API](http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html).
